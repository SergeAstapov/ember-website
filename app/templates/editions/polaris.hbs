    Polaris represents a big shift towards interoperability with the general JavaScript ecosystem.
    Developers will find a new <a href="https://github.com/ember-template-imports/ember-template-imports">authoring format for components</a> that further simplifies their usage,
    a new <a href="https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider">build pipeline</a> that hooks into the tool of your choice (webpack, rollup, etc), and a new <a href="https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-resources">reactivity system</a>.
