  <p class="intro">
    It has arrived!
    As of version 3.15 of Ember, when you generate a new app, you get everything you need to build your app using Octane.
    You can read more about features and upgrade strategies in the
    <a href="https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/12/20/octane-is-here.html">the official Ember blog post</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    Ember Octane describes a set of new features that, when taken together, represent a foundational improvement to the way you use Ember.
    It has modern, streamlined components and state management that make it fun to build web applications.
    With seamless interoperability for existing apps, teams can migrate at their own pace, while developers building new apps start out with the best that Ember has to offer.

  <h2>How you can help</h2>
  <p>
    Now that Octane is available, we ask developers of all experience levels to create their own blog posts, tutorials, and videos.
    Even if you think a topic has already been covered by someone else, it is helpful to put it in your own words.
    For most developers, official documentation is only one piece of the learning journey.
  </p>
